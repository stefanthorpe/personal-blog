<p>Caylent will be exhibiting at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC from May 15-17th. If you&rsquo;re planning on attending, we&rsquo;d like to invite you to stop by our booth to hang out with us and grab some free swag. We are going to be on the floor doing demos and we&rsquo;d love to see you!</p>
<p>Caylent is exhibiting in Startup Alley inside the Microsoft Pavilion, courtesy of our friends there. We recently wrapped up a project with the Microsoft Developer Experience team and are pleased to announce that Azure support will soon be coming to Caylent.</p>
<p>Microsoft approached us last year about partnering together for a joint open source project around Azure, which will be published soon along with an accompanying case study. Like many other cloud providers, Microsoft has been making inroads with the container community and also felt our core mission around enabling DevOps within organizations was important and timely for Azure customers.</p>
<p>Our vision has always been to allow software teams to &ldquo;build once and deploy anywhere&rdquo; as part of a cloud agnostic strategy. Cross-cloud and hybrid cloud are becoming increasingly important for many Enterprises and we feel strongly that offering development and operations teams more choices is essential.</p>
<p>More details on our Azure integration will be forthcoming in the near future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are looking forward to seeing some of you at TechCrunch Disrupt next week!</p>
