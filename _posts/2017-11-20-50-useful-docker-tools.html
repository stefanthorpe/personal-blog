<h1 id="OandS"><strong>Orchestration and Schedulers</strong></h1>
<h2>1. Kubernetes</h2>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2146 alignnone" src="http://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kubernetes-300x74.png" alt="Google Kubernetes" width="300" height="74" /></p>
<p>Kubernetes is the defacto, most popular container orchestration engine available on the market. Initially begun as a Google project, thousands of teams use it to deploy containers in production. Google claims it runs billions of containers using Kubernetes every week.<br />
The tool works by grouping containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://kubernetes.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kubernetes.io</a></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p>
<h2>2. Docker Swarm</h2>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2147 alignnone" src="http://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/docker-300x72.png" alt="Docker" width="300" height="72" /></p>
<p>Swarm is Docker&rsquo;s answer to a developer&rsquo;s problem of how to orchestrate and schedule containers across many servers. Swarm has been included in Docker Engine since version 1.12.0, and offers advanced features such as baked-in service discovery, load balancing, scaling, and security.</p>
<p>Swarm continues in Docker&rsquo;s tradition of focusing on simplicity and the developer experience. It is arguably easier to use than Kubernetes out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.docker.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free Community Edition</p>
<h2>3. Mesosphere DC/OS</h2>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2148 alignnone" src="http://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mesosphere-DCOS-300x110.png" alt="Mesosphere DCOS" width="300" height="110" /></p>
<p>Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS) is an integrated open-source platform for data and containers built on the Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel. It is designed to treat multiple machines within a data center as one or more clusters either in the cloud or using on-premise software. DC/OS can deploy containers and manage both stateless applications and stateful workloads in the same environment.</p>
<p>Works with Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://dcos.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dcos.io/</a></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Mesosphere DC/OS subscription packages are based on the number of nodes (physical or virtual) in your environment.</p>
<h2>4. Amazon ECS</h2>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2149 alignnone" src="http://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AmazonECS-300x122.png" alt="AmazonECS" width="300" height="122" /></p>
<p>Amazon Web Services&rsquo; answer to container orchestration, Amazon ECS is a highly scalable management service which allows developers to run containerized applications on EC2 instances. It is composed of multiple built-in components to enable the simple scheduling and deployment of Docker clusters, tasks, and services.</p>
<p>While there is no support for running containers outside of EC2, the benefits include AWS service advantages such as CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Elastic Load Balancers, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/</a></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Amazon ECS comes at no additional cost. Pay only for the AWS resources (e.g. EC2 instances or EBS volumes) necessary to store and run your application.</p>
<h2>5. Azure Container Service (ACS)</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2150" src="http://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Azure-Container-Service-ACS.png" alt="Azure Container Service (ACS)" width="270" height="130" /></p>
<p>An open-source management service optimized for use on Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Container Service provides the necessary tools to create, configure, and manage open Docker container infrastructure. It offers simplified container-based application development and deployment with support for Kubernetes, Mesospere DC/OS, or Swarm for orchestration.</p>
<p>Scale and orchestrate using application management tools of your choice and connect via standard API endpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/</a></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Pay only for the virtual machines, and associated storage and networking resources used.</p>
<h2>6. Google Container Engine (GKE)</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2151 alignnone" src="http://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Google-Container-Engine-GKE-300x300.png" alt="Google Container Engine (GKE)" width="193" height="193" /></p>
<p>Powered by Kubernetes, GKE can deploy, manage and scale containerized applications on Google Cloud. GKE&rsquo;s aim is to optimize IT team productivity by improving the management of container-based workloads. It hides both complex and simple management tasks behind easy user experience and straightforward command line tools.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is the backbone of GKE. While you don&rsquo;t need to learn it to use GKE, it helps if you understand the basics.</p>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/</a></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free for 0-5 nodes, 6+ nodes = $0.15/hr ($109.50/mo) per cluster</p>
<h2>7. Cloud Foundry&rsquo;s Diego</h2>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2152 alignnone" src="http://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cloud-Foundry&rsquo;s-Diego-300x101.png" alt="Cloud Foundry&rsquo;s Diego" width="300" height="101" /></p>
<p>Cloud Foundry uses its Diego architecture to manage application containers within the &lsquo;garden&rsquo; environment. Garden follows Linux&rsquo;s Open Container Initiative guidelines for hosting containers and is abstracted through Diego&rsquo;s other components. The Diego elements offer application scheduling and management capabilities through the Cloud Controller.</p>

<p>Marathon is a private production-grade Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) built on Apache Mesos. The Marathon framework promises to scale Dockerized applications and expand to more nodes when necessary to increase the available resource pool. It can also act as a container orchestration tool to provide fault recovery for containerized workloads. Marathon automatically handles hardware or software failures and ensures that an application is "always on."</p>
