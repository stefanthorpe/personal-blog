<p>Not sure what to get the developer in your life for the Holidays? You&rsquo;re not alone. Developers are notoriously tricky to buy gifts for &ndash; especially when the person doing the gifting thinks &ldquo;containers&rdquo; are big plastic tubs made for storing Christmas decorations.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, Caylent has you covered. We've compiled our top gifts for developers wishlist to help you out during the festive season.&nbsp;Anything from our 2017 Developer Gift Guide is sure to delight and compute, no matter your budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. TWSU Electro-Dough Kit</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/electro-dough-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2268 size-large" src="https://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TWSU-Electro-Dough-1024x512.jpg" alt="Link to buy TWSU-Electro-Dough KIt" width="1024" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>This adorable and affordable kit is perfect for the young-at-heart developer. Watch them bring art to life using homemade dough, buzzers, LEDs, household items, and more. Not only does this gift come with its own recipe book, it almost guarantees a special &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; mention when Programmer Picasso opens his first exhibit at The Met.<br />
<em>$26.99. Pairs nicely with RAM.</em></p>

<h2>2. Raspberry Pi Zero W</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2269" src="https://caylent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/raspberry-pi-zero-w.jpg" alt="Link to buy Raspberry Pi Zero W" width="1024" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>This is the well-dressed cousin of the Raspberry Pi Zero. It comes packed with all the power and punch of Pi Zero v1.3, but with a few major upgrades in the form of built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy. While this is absolutely a gold-star gift, it&rsquo;s important to note that your developer will need to have a few extra supplies on hand to turn it into a computer. Consider upgrading to a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starter pack bundle</a> to make sure they have everything they need.<br />
<em>$10. Pairs nicely with RAM.</em></p>

<p>Say hello to their little friends! Place the EcoSphere Closed Aquatic Ecosystem on your developer&rsquo;s desk to ensures they never face another Nginx configuration challenge alone. This self-sustaining sphere comes filled with shrimp, algae, and microorganisms that don&rsquo;t require any more than a comfortable room temperature and source of light &ndash; just like some developers!<br />
<em>$79.99 &ndash; $489.99. Pairs nicely with RAM.</em></p>

<p>Does it ever feel like your developer doesn&rsquo;t listen? Well, if you buy these, you&rsquo;ll finally know why. Bose offers a variety of makes and models, each designed to let your developer block out noise and optimize music for up to 40 hours on a single charge. These are a must-have on our gifts for developers wishlist! Please note, some of these headphones are built and optimized for specific operating systems, so you&rsquo;ll need to buy the ones that match your developer&rsquo;s system preferences.<br />

<p>Nothing says &ldquo;I get you&rdquo; like a fully customizable keyboard. The CODE keyboard lets developers configure their keys as they see fit, switching between a variety of layouts, including QWERTY, Dvorak, and Colemak. They&rsquo;ll also be able to build their own shortcuts, disable commands, swap commands, and more, all with the flip of switches located on the back of the keyboard.<br />
