<h1>A Docker Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a> is becoming increasingly popular. Developers and system administrators are discovering just how headache free it is to port applications. Container technology allows for the launch and configuration of all dependencies quickly and easily.</p>
<h1>The Container Principle</h1>
<p>The open-source program takes its name from the shipping containers credited as the invention of a guy called Malcolm Mclean, a trucker, who came up with a standardized way of loading cargo from trucks to ships and warehouses. The strong uniform design was theft resistant and easy to load and unload. Docker has virtualized this principle with container technology. And developers can use Docker to &lsquo;build, ship, and run&rsquo; applications on top of a Linux instance. And just like their large metal counterparts, they provide an isolated space for the whole team to work within.</p>
<p>Development, build, test and operations teams; they all stand to gain from using container software. The tech provides a virtual isolation area where things can move around without consideration of the contents. At a considerably quicker speed over VMs. They are more efficient in comparison to hypervisors, in terms of systems resources due to their shared operating systems. They each have their own isolated user space. This means you can run multiple containers (LXCs) together (without foregoing user space) on a single host. It is their standardization that stands them apart from other companies offering similar tech.</p>
<h1>The Next Step</h1>
