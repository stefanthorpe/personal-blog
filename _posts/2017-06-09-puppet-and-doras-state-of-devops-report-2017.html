<p>This week saw <a href="https://puppet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppet</a>&rsquo;s release of its annual <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report">State of DevOps report</a>;&nbsp;the oft-quoted research that every DevOps practitioner across the globe will be intimate with. In collaboration with <a href="https://devops-research.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DORA</a>&mdash;DevOps Research and Assessment&mdash;Puppet has been measuring the evolutionary impact of DevOps on IT performance for the last six years through a survey of a record 27,000 IT professionals. Each year, the research analyzes the statistical&mdash;and dramatic&mdash;development of high- and low- performing IT teams. Teams who are all striving to deliver &ldquo;software faster, more reliable, and with fewer errors&rdquo; in line with DevOps best practices.</p>
<h4>Puppet's State of DevOps Report Webinar</h4>
<p>On June 8th, two of the report&rsquo;s authors&mdash;director of product marketing Alanna Brown and chief technical strategist Nigel Kersten&mdash;discussed the latest findings on a Puppet moderated webinar. Top of their discovery is the rise in DevOps adoption gaining traction in IT. In 2014, 16% of the survey respondents worked on DevOps teams; the 2017 research indicates 27% now work on such a team.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this year&rsquo;s report places focus on how DevOps can work for all organizations, from for-profit to not-for-profit. It concentrates on the connection the DevOps language creates between IT and the rest of the business; whatever that business may be. Nigel Kersten explains, &ldquo;The goal is not just to &lsquo;do&rsquo; DevOps&mdash;not just &lsquo;do&rsquo; digital transformation. The goal has to ultimately be about shipping value to the business. And being connected to the rest of the business is one of the most interesting developments of the report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puppet used a snowballing method to reach out to 3,200 respondents across a diverse range of organizations and industries. By using statistical cluster analysis, Puppet segmented the survey respondents into high, medium, and low-performance groups. This is based on the teams functionality across four key measures: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, Mean time to recover (MTTR), and change failure rate.</p>
<h4>What Does High-Performing Mean?</h4>
<p>To become "high-performing," the DevOps Report reinforces that organizations should be all about automating processes. Allowing the business to focus on delivering customer value and higher order initiatives. This research aligns with Caylent&rsquo;s vision of the future and our product. As Alanna Brown deftly put it, &ldquo;Automation is a critical differentiator for organizations. It&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;re going to accelerate your business and solve tomorrow&rsquo;s problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our simple infrastructure deployments and fully automated continuous deployment (CD) systems empower teams. By enabling them to automate processes and compete with the high performers who already automate 30% more of their deployment. CD contributes to &ldquo;both lower deployment pain and higher IT performance.&rdquo; Caylent's DevOps Container Management system aims to meet this market niche. We handle all the orchestration and automation, this way you can simply focus on building and testing code. In true DevOps style.</p>
<p>Thank you to the 2017 State of DevOps Report authors Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Alanna Brown, and Nigel Kersten.</p>
