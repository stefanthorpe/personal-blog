<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significant changes and improvements are coming to Caylent as part of our upcoming v2 release. We&rsquo;ve introduced a number of new features and updates that we hope you&rsquo;ll love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On February 14, 2017 we will be relocating the v1 API URL and discontinuing support for it. The API and web app will be moved to api.app.legacy.caylent.com/v1/ and </span><a href="http://app.legacy.caylent.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">app.legacy.caylent.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, respectively. We do not anticipate any disruption to stacks that have already been deployed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beta v2 will continue to be hosted at </span><a href="https://app.caylent.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">app.caylent.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Important Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we make this switch over, we will be resetting our production database. Unfortunately, the nature of some of the changes was structural, making a database migration effectively impossible. This means if you previously had an account, you will need to register a new one. It will not affect your place in the waitlist. We apologize for any inconvenience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>App Collections (feature)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are introducing Application Collections, which are essentially groups of containers that form an entire application (i.e. API, backend, or website). An App Collection could be a single container, or more likely dozens or even hundreds of containers that share a common parent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">App Collections and Stacks can form interconnecting many-to-many relationships. For example, an App Collection can be associated with multiple Stacks, and a Stack can be associated with many App Collections. This gives users the flexibility to deploy multiple Swarm clusters to the same infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stacks &amp; Environments (update)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacks and Environments are infrastructure, plain and simple. EC2 servers are the bread and butter, but stacks also include load balancers, EBS-backed storage, and other stuff needed to run Docker Swarm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every stack includes an environment tag that helps identify it, like Development, QA, Staging, or Production.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stack Services (update)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A service is a collection of resources that expose a particular feature. Examples include Docker Swarm, RDS, Elastic Load Balancers, etc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Databases (update)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now officially support all databases available within RDS including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, amongst others. High Availability is the default on these databases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup retention period is 35 days by default (the maximum), but can be changed through our API.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Docker Swarm (feature)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now fully support Docker v1.12+ and Docker Swarm. Docker Swarm is at the heart of every stack and the Swarm is initialized automatically when the stack is launched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stack, by default, always runs Docker Swarm and can be configured with 1, 3, or 5 managers. The managers are separated into their own fixed auto-scaling group (ASG) which allows for automated recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The worker nodes are deployed into their own dynamic ASG, which allows for load-based scaling and recovery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Continuous Delivery (feature)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;re excited to introduce a simple but powerful way for our users to achieve Continuous Delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can now map container image tags to specific stacks (i.e. &lsquo;latest&rsquo; should deploy to Production). We can also recognize regex patterns which, for example, allow for all container builds to be deployed to a particular stack (i.e. &lsquo;*&rsquo; should deploy to Development). You can also do combinations (i.e. &lsquo;QA-*&rsquo; can deploy all builds with a QA- prefix to the QA stack).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;ll do a follow up blog post with more tips and best practices around CD and how you can leverage Caylent do version promotion across environments by re-tagging builds with or without a CI server.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>App Wizard (GUI feature)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we launched our alpha in June, our original cohort of users asked for a better onboarding experience. They wanted a wizard that would make it easier to launch their apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are introducing the App Wizard as a way of quickly launching App Collections and deploying all of the resources inside of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This effectively replaces our drag-and-drop Canvas, and we believe the result is a more user-friendly way to setup and deploy Docker containers, infrastructure, and continuous delivery pipelines.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bug Fixes &amp; Improvements</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning with v2 of our API, users can now:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PATCH /cloud-provider-credentials endpoint added</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GET /stacks/{{stackUuid}}/resources to see what&rsquo;s attached to a stack</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">POST /networks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PATCH /applications/{{appCollectionUuid}}</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">POST /app-collections/[[appCollectionUuid}}/add</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PATCH /applications/{{appUuid}} to change dependencies, image_uri, and name of existing applications (i.e. containers)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved two-step password reset</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GET /accounts for user details</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Instance size bug where user-defined instance sizes could be previously overwritten is now fixed.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we are migrating to API Gateway for improved reliability and access management.</span></p>
